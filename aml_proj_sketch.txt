- create chatgpt prompt containing .csv format and median values of .csv and instruction to format user input for model usage
- forward chatgpt response to model
- calculate SHAP
- forward prediction and shap results to chat gpt and instruction to make a sarcastic explanation and be ready for next query

if an users string does not contain any model-relevant data, say "Please provide relevant data" and nothing else
(if chat gpt response != "Please provide relevant data": call model)
