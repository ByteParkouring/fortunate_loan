- do not simply take default values combined with user values --> if the user says he is 3 years old, it makes no sense to keep default annual income of 80 000 dollars. Therefore proceed differently: 1. Tell GPT to just return the JSON key-value pairs of keys that have user-provided values. 2. The program should compute new mean / default values for all other attributes based on user-provided values and the internal .csv database. 3. The resulting new dataframe is to be used for prediction.

- regarding shap plot: keys whose values were not provided by values should have red bars instead of blue bars. A caption should be inserted to shortly state what the colors blue and red stand for.
